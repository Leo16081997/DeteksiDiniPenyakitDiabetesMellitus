# DeteksiDiniPenyakitDiabetesMellitus
ABSTRACT


Diabetes Mellitus is the body still produces insulin but does not produce enough amounts or the body has difficulty using insulin efficiently, it is called insulin resistance. Factors that cause Diabetes Mellitus can be grouped into three groups, namely sociodemography consisting of age, sex, and occupation. Behavioral and lifestyle factors such as vegetable and fruit consumption, smoking habits, alcohol consumption and physical activity. Clinical or mental states such as time indexes of the body (obesity), waist circumference (central obesity) and stress. Based on these factors often the public does not realize that he entered the category of Pre Diabetes Mellitus or is certainly exposed to Diabetes Mellitus. Most people are aware of themselves being exposed to Diabetes Mellitus when people experience other complications. This becomes a serious problem to prevent people from being exposed to Diabetes Mellitus
and may soon be aware of whether it is exposed to Diabetes Mellitus or not. With the problem of the issue, in this final task will be designed a system that can know of Dicky detection of dillius diabetes. This system is designed by using a computer - core forward system's method system that can via some data or some of the facts that are moving forward towards conclusions (goal). This drumpling deteer question is in the application of the application that was resources at the expert or doctors about factors and symptoms of diabetus and conclusions whether user diagility was exposed to mellius's diabetes or was not gained on the results of the accurate and valid


BACKGROUND


Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and its complications have become a serious public health problem and are an important cause of morbidity, mortality and disability rates throughout the world. Globally the DM day of the world is celebrated every November 14th, this proves that DM is a global problem that occurs in every country, both in developed countries and in poor and developing countries.
In this final project that needs to be detected early is Diabetes Mellitus Type 1 and Type 2 because Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 (DMT2) is caused by age, environmental conditions, unhealthy lifestyles such as consuming foods or drinks that are high in sugar, smoking and rarely exercising and Diabetes Mellitus Type 1 (DMT1) is caused by genetic factors (hereditary disease inherited from previous offspring) and autoimmune (destruction of pancreatic beta cells that have little or no insulin secretion can be determined by the level of cpeptide protein whose numbers are few or not detected at all). In addition, DMT1 and DMT2 need to do early detection because DM is a disease that tends to be less aware, usually someone only realizes it if they already experience complications of DM.
To implement this system design, an expert system method is needed, namely Forward Chaining. Expert system is useful for analyzing in solving a problem in order to get a solution or answer that is valid and accurate in analyzing a problem, in this case is to analyze whether someone has DM, pre-DM or not DM. Expert system analysis based on the Forward Chaining method that represents expert knowledge (knowledge base) in accordance with the facts of the conditions experienced by the user (initial state) who move forward to take the decision tree Depth First Search to get conclusions (goals).
Therefore the title of this thesis is "Designing of Early Diabetes Mellitus Detection Application Using Forward Chaining Classification Method on Android-Based Expert System" in order to have a positive and beneficial impact on the community because it does not have to cost a fortune and spend a lot of time for consultation and checking to hospital.
